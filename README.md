# Miss Fritters

Miss Fritters is currently a test of Llama3 using Ollama.

## Installation

Download Ollama and run llama3 locally first - https://ollama.com/blog/llama3

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install pyttsx3, requests, and speech_recognition

If you want to use advanced_tts instead of the simple, it requires a bit more...

For Windows, it also requires build tools:

- Go to https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/, Check Desktop development with C++, and install
- Use pip to install coqui-tts
